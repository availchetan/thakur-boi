							<h2>Recent Learnings</h2>
							<p>Sure! Here's a detailed elaboration on how to handle toxic behavior from a senior team member:

---

### üîç **First Step: 1:1 Conversations ‚Äì Understand the Underlying Cause**

Before jumping to conclusions or disciplinary actions, the first move should be a **private, empathetic 1:1 conversation**.

- **Objective**: Understand *why* the behavior is happening.
- **Look for potential causes**:
  - **Burnout**: Are they overloaded? Showing signs of fatigue, irritability, or disengagement?
  - **Role mismatch**: Are they doing work that doesn‚Äôt play to their strengths?
  - **Personal challenges**: Are there life events affecting their mood or focus?
- **Approach**: Be non-confrontational, use open-ended questions like:
  - ‚ÄúI‚Äôve noticed some tension in recent meetings. How are things going on your end?‚Äù
  - ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs been feeling most challenging in your work lately?‚Äù

> ‚ö†Ô∏è This phase is about listening, *not judging*. Show concern for their well-being while observing patterns.

---

### üìà **Supportive Performance Improvement Plan (PIP)**

If issues persist or are performance-related, consider a **Supportive PIP**, not a punitive one.

- **Set Clear Expectations**:
  - Define what ‚Äúsuccess‚Äù looks like in specific, measurable terms.
  - Examples: ‚ÄúAll code reviews completed in 48 hours,‚Äù or ‚ÄúProfessional tone maintained in standups.‚Äù
- **Timeline**: Typically 4‚Äì6 weeks.
- **Structure**:
  - Weekly check-ins to review progress.
  - Provide feedback and support (coaching, resources, etc.).
  - Encourage questions and two-way dialogue.

> ‚ú® Emphasize the goal is to *support* them in improving, not to set them up to fail.

---

### üö© **If Behavior is Toxic (e.g., Undermining, Hostile, Disrespectful)**

Some behaviors cross the line and affect team culture and morale. In such cases:

#### 1. **Give Direct Feedback ‚Äì Use the SBI Model**  
The **Situation-Behavior-Impact** (SBI) model helps deliver clear and non-judgmental feedback:

- **Situation**: ‚ÄúIn yesterday‚Äôs team meeting‚Ä¶‚Äù
- **Behavior**: ‚Äú‚Ä¶you interrupted two junior members and dismissed their ideas abruptly‚Ä¶‚Äù
- **Impact**: ‚Äú‚Ä¶which made them hesitant to contribute and visibly discouraged.‚Äù

> üéØ Focus on observable behavior, not assumptions or character judgments.

#### 2. **Loop in HR or Skip-Level Manager Early**
- Escalate early if:
  - Behavior continues despite feedback.
  - You feel unsafe or the impact is spreading across the team.
- HR can help document, mediate, and initiate formal actions if necessary.

---

### üö™ **If No Improvement ‚Üí Transition Out Quickly**

If there's no meaningful improvement:
- Begin **formal offboarding or role transition** (in consultation with HR).
- Prioritize team morale and psychological safety.
- Be **transparent but discreet** with the team‚Äîacknowledge the change without airing details.

---

### üìù **Always Document Everything**

Keep a **record of:
- Dates of conversations
- Observed behaviors
- Feedback given
- Responses/actions taken

This protects you and ensures fairness in decision-making.

---

### üí° **Tone Matters: Be Clear, Kind, and Firm**

You can be **empathetic without being permissive**. Use a tone that:
- Communicates care for the individual
- Prioritizes team health
- Is honest about what will and won‚Äôt be tolerated
